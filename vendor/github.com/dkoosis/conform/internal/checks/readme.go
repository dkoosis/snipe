// ReadmeFile is the one file the repo root must carry (decision d9cd0e20868b,
// dk 2026-09-02). Every other direction document moved under docs/ so that
// GitHub's repo page shows this file's first paragraph without scrolling —
// which is the legibility test the decision names, and it fails the same way
// whether the root is crowded or the README is absent.
//
// root-minimal is the deny half of that decision and this is the require half.
// They are separate rules because they fail for opposite reasons and their
// repairs point opposite ways: one says move a file out, the other says write

// Three failures, deliberately distinct. Absent means the repo page has no

// roadmap is: the file exists, so every reader stops looking. Present with no
// opening heading is the shape GitHub renders as a wall of prose with nothing
// naming what it is looking at.
//
// What is NOT checked: whether the heading matches the repo's name. Nothing in
// a repo states its own canonical name — a worktree, a fork, a clone under
// another directory name and a submodule checkout all disagree with each
// other, and go.mod is absent under the lib and non-Go profiles. A checker
// that compared the heading to filepath.Base(dir) would fire on every
// worktree in the fleet, so this rule guards the artifact's existence and its
// one machine-read line, the same bargain checkRoadmap strikes with the ★.
