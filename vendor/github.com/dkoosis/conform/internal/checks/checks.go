// Package checks implements Surface 1: the in-repo file checks that run bare
// (`conform`) inside a repository, every `make check`, hard-fail.
//
// Every finding names the file, the rule id, and a repair command. There is no
// soft-fail: a rule too noisy to hard-fail gets deleted, not warned.
//
// Rule ids are the shared vocabulary between this checker and the values
// file's exceptions (see internal/values): a repo excepts a rule by listing
// its id in conform.json with a reason. Ids are kebab-case and stable.
