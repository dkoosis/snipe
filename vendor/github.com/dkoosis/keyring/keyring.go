// Package keyring stores and retrieves secrets in the macOS keychain via the
// `security` CLI — no cgo, no third-party dependency. Secrets never appear on
// a process argv, writes are verified by read-back, and "not found" is kept
// strictly distinct from "could not read" so callers get an honest answer to
// "does this exist right now" — but that answer is a point-in-time read, not
// an atomic guard: `security add-generic-password -U` unconditionally
// overwrites on Set, so a concurrent writer between a caller's presence
// check and its Set is clobbered with no error to either side. Has is
// advisory, not a compare-and-swap; this package assumes one writer per
// account unless callers serialize writes per (service, account) themselves
// or use SetIfAbsent, which offers write-once semantics instead. See Has,
// SetIfAbsent.
//
// PRECONDITION: exactly one (service, account) item across the keychain
// search list, or a pinned keychain. `find-generic-password` returns the
// FIRST match in keychain search order and `add-generic-password -U`
// updates "the" matching item — whichever one that search order picks. A
// duplicate item planted by another tool in a higher-priority keychain
// means Get can return that other item's value (stale or
// attacker-controlled) and Set's read-back can verify against it too,
// masking a write to the wrong item. Callers that cannot guarantee
// uniqueness across the search list MUST pin a keychain with WithKeychain.
// See WithKeychain and the README's "Single-item assumption" section.
//
// Service names, account names, and values must be printable ASCII
// (0x20-0x7e): `security find-generic-password -w` hex-transcribes any
// stored value containing a byte >=0x80 on read, indistinguishable from a
// real value, so Set refuses non-ASCII input up front. Encode non-ASCII or
// multi-line material (e.g. base64) before storing.
//
// On non-darwin builds every keychain operation returns ErrUnsupported;
// GetOrEnv falls through to the environment there, so cross-platform callers
// can use one code path.
